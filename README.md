<h1>Filtering Network Traffic with Firewalls</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Description: A firewall monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic. Thereâ€™s a misconception that the firewall is always the last line of defense but in reality, a perimeter firewall should be the first obstacle bad actors encounter when they try to penetrate any network.

In this project, I will use two firewall solutions: iptables and pfSense. Iptables is a common firewall often used as a host firewall in Linux. pfSense can be implemented either as an open source software firewall or as a hardware firewall, however in this project I will be using the open source software.

<h2>iptables</h2>

<b>Linux's iptables utility offers great flexibility in filtering traffic entering, traversing, or leaving a network. iptable organizes its rules in policy chains, lists of rules that analyze and match packets based on their contents. Each rule determines what the firewall will do with a packet that matches its definition. It might allow, reject or drop the packet. If the packet is allowed, it will pass the firewall unhindered, when it drops the packet, the firewall will discard the packet and send no response back to the sender. When the packet is rejected, the firewall discards the packet and sends a rejection message to the sender.

<h4>Three main types of policy chain: Input chains, output chains, and forward chains</h4>

- <b>Input chains - Determine whether to allow certain traffic into the network from an external source.</b>

- <b>Output chains - Indicate whether the firewall should allow certain outbound traffic to an external network.</b>

- <b>Forward chains - Forward the traffic your firewall receives to another network.</b>


<h2>Installing iptables</h2>

<b>I've already built a standard Ubuntu server, so now I can start configuring its iptable firewall.

Recent Ubuntu systems have iptables installed by default but we can always check by running the following command:
</b>
<p align="center">
<img src=" sudo iptables -V command picture goes here" height="25%" width="75%" />
</p>

<b>If iptables is installed, the server should return the version information. If iptables is not installed, you'll receive an error, indicating you'll need to make the install</b>

<p align="center">
<img src=" sudo apt install iptables here " height="25%" width="75%" />
</p>

<b>Next, I'll install iptables-persistent, a tool that allows you to save your firewall configurations and automatically reload them after a reboot of the server</b>
